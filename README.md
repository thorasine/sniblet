## Work In Progress!

Blog-like site I'm making to exercise different technologies and best practices.

# Technical Info

The server is built on **Java 15** with **Maven** and **Docker** in **IntelliJ IDEA** using **Spring Boot 2.5.0** as the main framework along with its **Web**, **JPA**, **MySQL**, **Test** dependencies so far.  

The website will be built with **Angular**, **HTML** and **CSS**.  User authentication will be done with **OAuth2**. The data exchange between the site and the server is through **REST** services.

Data persistence is handled by **Hibernate** with **JPA**. The users data is stored in a **MySQL** database.  

Tests will be done with **JUnit 5**, **AssertJ** and **Mockito**.
